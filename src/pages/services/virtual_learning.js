                                                        Virtual learning removes the physical presence requirement, allowing for flexibility in scheduling 
                                                        and location. Unlike traditional learning, it relies heavily on technology and often includes a mix 
                                                        of synchronous (live) and asynchronous (pre-recorded or self-paced) activities.
