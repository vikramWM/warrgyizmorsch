                                        By limiting the access of telemarketers to personal phone numbers, call preference services help safeguard consumer privacy. 
                                        This protection is vital in an era where personal information is increasingly susceptible to misuse and exploitation.

                                        Unwanted calls can be a major source of distraction, particularly during work hours or personal time. Call preference services 
                                        significantly reduce these interruptions, allowing individuals to focus on more important tasks without frequent disturbances.

                                        The CPS empowers consumers by giving them a tool to assert their preferences and control over their interactions. This empowerment 
                                        extends to reporting violations, thereby holding companies accountable for non-compliance.

                                    <h3>How Call Preference Services Work</h3>
                                    <p className="mb-4">
                                        Call preference services operate by maintaining a registry of phone numbers belonging to individuals who have operated out of receiving 
                                        telemarketing calls. In many countries, regulatory bodies oversee these services to ensure compliance and effectiveness. For instance, 
                                        in the United States, the National Do Not Call Registry, managed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), allows consumers to register 
                                        their phone numbers and reduce the number of telemarketing calls they receive.
                                        <br />
                                        Once a number is registered, telemarketers are legally required to remove it from their call lists. Failure to compulsory can result 
                                        in significant fines and penalties. This regulatory framework not only deters companies from engaging in aggressive telemarketing 
                                        practices but also provides consumers with a tangible sense of control over their communication channels.

                                                        out of receiving marketing calls. This helps maintain a positive relationship with customers and avoids potential fines 
                                                        or penalties for non-compliance with regulations. Additionally, respecting customers' preferences contributes to a better 
                                                        overall reputation for the company, fostering trust and loyalty among consumers.

                                                        marketing calls. You register your phone number on the TPS website, by phone, or by mail. After about 28 days, 
                                                        telemarketers are legally required to avoid calling your number. If you still get marketing calls, you can report 
                                                        them, and the company may be fined. TPS registration lasts indefinitely, but you can remove your number anytime if
